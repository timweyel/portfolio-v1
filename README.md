Deployed Application: https://timweyel.github.io/portfolio/

This is my portfolio page created as a project in my UC Berkeley Bootcamp. We were to create a page that met the following goal from the standpoint of a potential employer:

**View a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.**

Additionally, we need to meet the following supporting features:
- Ability to see developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- Navigation links scroll to the corresponding section
- The navigation link 'work' scrolls to the section with the images of the work
- The first application image is larger than the others
- The images have links to the applications websites
- The page is responsive
